## Working Thesis: The Dollar Is Weakening — But How?

We resonate with the idea that the dollar is losing its edge, but "the dollar goes down" can mean many different things. The nuance matters because it determines what we track and what we invest in.

### The Many Faces of Dollar Weakness

| Dimension | What It Means | Can Diverge? |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **DXY (vs fiat basket)** | Dollar falls vs euro, yen, pound, etc. | Yes — all fiat can lose purchasing power together while DXY stays flat |
| **Purchasing power (real)** | Inflation > interest rates. Dollar buys less stuff. | Yes — DXY can be strong while real purchasing power erodes (stealth debasement) |
| **Vs gold / hard money** | Gold reprices higher in dollar terms | Yes — gold can rise while DXY rises (both can happen simultaneously) |
| **Vs commodities** | Oil, copper, food cost more dollars | Tied to purchasing power but also supply/demand dynamics |
| **Reserve share** | Foreign CBs hold fewer dollar reserves | Slow-moving, but compounds. Measurable via IMF COFER data |
| **Treasury market function** | Auctions weaken, Fed forced to intervene as buyer-of-last-resort | The structural backbone — if this breaks, everything else accelerates |
| **Trade settlement** | Countries bypass dollar for bilateral trade | Petroyuan, BRICS, local currency swaps — reduces marginal dollar demand |

### Key Insight

These dimensions can **diverge massively**:
- Dollar can be "strong" on DXY while losing purchasing power (2022-2023 pattern)
- Gold can rise while DXY rises (2024-2025 pattern)
- Reserve share can erode slowly while DXY stays elevated (happening now)

## The 5 Theses

_These are claims about how the world is structurally changing. Not trades — the trades flow from these._

### Thesis 1: The dollar is structurally weakening

The US dollar's dominance — as reserve currency, trade settlement medium, and store of value — is eroding on multiple fronts simultaneously. This is the central thesis; the others orbit it.

**The mechanism (fiscal dominance):** The debt/deficit trajectory has passed the point of no return. Interest expense compounds on itself. DOGE at maximum effort still yields 5.5% deficit/GDP. There is no political path to fiscal consolidation — only monetization. The Fed's independence is functionally over; it will accommodate regardless of inflation because the alternative is worse. Nothing stops this train.

**The barometer (10y Treasury):** The 10-year yield is where the stress shows up. Waning foreign demand (Japan, China reducing holdings), persistent deficits requiring ever-larger issuance, Fed forced to step in as buyer-of-last-resort. Watch here for early warning signals.

**The scoreboard (gold):** Central banks accumulating gold instead of Treasuries. Gold reprices higher as the market's verdict on trust in the monetary system. (Louis Gave's "3 things to watch" — dollar, 10y, and likely gold — triangulate this thesis.)

**Multiple dimensions:** Dollar weakness can manifest as DXY decline (vs fiat basket), purchasing power erosion (stealth debasement), repricing vs hard assets (gold rises even as DXY is flat), reserve share erosion (slow but compounding), Treasury market dysfunction, or trade settlement bypass. These can diverge — dollar can be "strong" on DXY while losing purchasing power.

_Key thinkers: Alden, Gromen, Gave, Thompson_

### Thesis 2: China is ascending as the counterweight

China is not just a manufacturing powerhouse — it is undergoing two specific transformations that matter:

**Domestic consumption pivot:** China's growth model is shifting from export/investment-led to consumption-driven. The government is running larger fiscal deficits focused specifically on boosting domestic demand. This is the next phase of China's development — and it's a massive market being unlocked.

**Financial market reform:** Chinese equities are undergoing a structural reform that makes them investable in ways they haven't been before. The regulatory environment is stabilizing, market infrastructure is improving, and the government has a strategic interest in functional capital markets. The era of "China is uninvestable" is ending.

On top of this: manufacturing dominance (EVs, batteries, solar, chips, shipbuilding, rare earths), tech competitive or superior to US in many sectors, China as "de facto central bank" for emerging markets. Equities still cheap relative to US.

_Key thinkers: Gave, Thompson_

### Thesis 3: The world is fragmenting — 战国时期

We are entering a Warring States period. The unipolar, neocon-driven framework of US hegemony is being dismantled — not just by external challengers but by the US itself (America First, retrenchment). What replaces it is not a new order but contested multipolarity.

**Key dynamics:**
- BRICS+ expansion, bilateral currency agreements, regional alliances
- US military stretched across 6+ theaters (Caribbean, Ukraine, Israel/Iran, Yemen, Venezuela, Nigeria)
- Trade routes, supply chains, financial infrastructure, and technology stacks all bifurcating
- Every country building strategic reserves — the era of "just-in-time" is becoming "just-in-case"
- **Energy as the currency of power** — energy security is becoming a core national security priority. The countries that control energy production, refining, and distribution hold disproportionate leverage. "Energy IS the economy" (Gromen).

_Key thinkers: Gave, Gromen_

### Thesis 4: AI is a genuine productivity boom

This is the wildcard. AI is not a bubble — it's a real technological revolution that will reshape how economies function. But the implications are deeply uncertain and cut in multiple directions:

- **Deflationary force?** — AI dramatically reduces the cost of knowledge work, software, analysis, content. This could be a once-in-a-generation productivity surge that suppresses inflation.
- **Inflationary capex sink?** — The build-out requires massive investment in data centers, power generation, chips, raw materials. Energy CPI is already the hottest inflation component. The "space race" dynamic means overinvestment and subpar returns on capex.
- **Who benefits?** — The beneficiaries may rotate from the builders (Mag7, semis) to the enablers (power, energy, raw materials) to the adopters (businesses that use AI to cut costs/boost revenue). Leadership is shifting downstream.
- **Labor disruption** — Political backlash rising as AI threatens jobs and raises energy costs. This feeds into the populist dynamics of Thesis 1 and the election calculus.

The honest answer: we believe this is real but don't know how it plays out. Track it, watch it, stay open-minded.

_Key thinkers: Thompson, broadly consensus_

### Thesis 5: Hard assets are entering a structural bull market

The era of financial assets outperforming real assets (roughly 2008-2020) is reversing. We are in the early-to-middle innings of a hard assets supercycle driven by:

- **Chronic underinvestment** — A decade of low capex in mining, energy, and commodities during the ESG/zero-rate era created structural supply deficits
- **Monetary debasement** — When all governments choose inflation over austerity, hard assets are the natural hedge
- **Energy transition demand** — Electrification, renewables, EVs require massive amounts of copper, lithium, uranium, rare earths
- **Geopolitical premium** — In a fragmenting world (Thesis 3), scarce resources command a premium. Strategic hoarding adds to demand.
- **Sovereign bond bear market** — The 40-year bond bull is over. Japan 10yr breaking out, global yields in structural uptrend. When bonds lose their role as portfolio ballast, capital flows to alternatives. Gold, commodities, real assets become the new "safe haven."

Gold is both a hard asset AND the scoreboard for Thesis 1 (dollar). Commodities/metals are both investable AND the physical backbone of Thesis 4 (AI infrastructure) and Thesis 3 (strategic reserves).

_Key thinkers: Alden, Gromen, Thompson_

                    Thesis 4 (AI) ← the wildcard that touches everything
```

Dollar weakness (1) is the central thesis. China's rise (2) is the counterweight. Fragmentation (3) is the structure enabling the shift. AI (4) is the wildcard that could accelerate or disrupt any of the above. Hard assets (5) are where these forces physically converge — the expression of debasement, the input to AI infrastructure, and the strategic currency of a fragmenting world.

### Open Questions

- [ ] What did Louis Gave identify as the 3rd thing to watch? (Dollar, 10y, and ???)
- [ ] What specific data would **disprove** each thesis?
- [ ] For China (Thesis 2): What specific reforms make equities "investable"? Elaborate later.
- [ ] For AI (Thesis 4): Are we tracking the deflationary or inflationary angle?
- [ ] For hard assets (Thesis 5): Which specific commodities? Gold, copper, uranium, oil — or a basket?

## Earlier Thesis Ideas (Folded Into Above)

These were considered as separate theses but are now incorporated:

1. ~~US fiscal unsustainability~~ → Folded into Thesis 1 as the "mechanism" behind dollar weakness
2. ~~China industrial dominance~~ → Refined into Thesis 2 with specific focus on consumption + financial reform
3. ~~Sovereign bond bear market~~ → Folded into Thesis 5 (hard assets) as a driver of capital reallocation
4. ~~Bitcoin as macro asset~~ → Parked for now. Could revisit as an expression of Thesis 1 or Thesis 3

## Quinn Thompson (Lekker Capital) — 2026 Macro Themes

_Source: [2026 Macro Themes](https://www.lekkercapital.com/p/2026-macro-themes) (Jan 7, 2026)_

1. **Midterms are existential for Trump** — Administration will prioritize winning 2026 midterms over stock market. Populist fiscal stimulus to buy voter support. Market is NOT the #1 priority.
2. **No recession — overheating risk** — 5+ year expansion, deficits ~5.5% despite DOGE. Three negative demand shocks (tariffs, spending cuts, immigration halt) are over. Replaced with tax breaks, capex incentives. Nominal growth stays strong.
3. **Global main street growth inflects higher** — All major economies running deficits (2-10%). Zero appetite for austerity. Credit creation rebounding. "Borrow now, debt gets inflated away." Sovereign yields in global uptrend (Japan 10yr breaking 2%).
4. **Stock-bond correlation flips positive** — Bonds face structural headwinds: deficits, waning foreign demand, Fed balance sheet reduction. Main street reinvigoration makes it worse for bonds. Stocks and bonds move together.
5. **Massive dispersion (winners vs losers)** — "Delicate balance" questions: stimulate main street without inflation? Weaken dollar for manufacturing while keeping capital inflows? How does Trump's Fed chair surprise even more dovish?

### How This Connects to Our Dollar Thesis

Quinn's framework strongly supports the dollar weakness thesis from multiple angles:
- **Fiscal dominance** (#2, #3): Persistent deficits + no austerity = structural debasement
- **Bond market stress** (#4): If foreigners step back from Treasuries → dollar loses its structural bid
- **Deliberate weakening** (#5): Admin may WANT a weaker dollar for manufacturing — it's a policy goal, not just a side effect
- **Global coordination** (#3): Everyone debasing simultaneously — the question is relative speed
- **Election incentive** (#1): Populist stimulus = more spending = more debasement

## Quinn Thompson (Lekker Capital) — 2026 Investable Ideas

_Source: [2026 Investable Ideas](https://www.lekkercapital.com/p/2026-investable-ideas) (Jan 15, 2026)_

1. **Main Street Reignition** — K-shaped economy must flip for midterms. 2025 lesson: "Main Street's turn" rhetoric backfired (Liberation Day selloff). 2026 they'll be subtler. Trade: short long-term bonds (yields rise), cyclicals over growth. Admin's choice: stimulate Main Street OR contain bond yields — they'll pick Main Street.

2. **New Fed Policy (Steeper Yield Curve)** — Financial repression: front-end low (rate cuts + Reserve Management Purchases), long-end rises. Fed actively reducing balance sheet duration — first since 1950s "bills-only" policy. This is a 180° pivot from 2022-2024 (BTFP, ATI, RRP drain, early QT end). Beneficiaries: commodities, energy, financials. Losers: long-duration, speculative, tech.

3. **Non-US Outperformance + Dollar Decline** — Most Mag7 underperformed S&P in 2025. Chinese equities still cheap, competitive tech sector, likely larger deficit in 2026 focused on domestic consumption. **Dollar call: another 5-10% decline in 2026.** Mechanism: trade deficit reduction → less foreign capital inflow into US assets → Fed must monetize → dollar bearish. NIIP at highs = peak. Liberation Day was the inflection. New Fed chair likely even more dovish under Trump pressure.

4. **AI Beneficiary Rotation** — AI megatrend persists but leadership moves downstream: power generation, energy, raw materials over Mag7/semis. Energy services CPI hottest component. Big tech's shift from capital-light to capex-heavy = subpar returns, potential equity dilution. Political pressure rising (AOC, Warren, Sanders vs datacenters).

5. **Geopolitics — The Mispricing**
   - US-China: Whether hot or cold, adversarial competition = premium on commodities, raw materials, scarce resources
   - Taiwan's value rising with AI boom → more coveted asset
   - US military stretched thin (Caribbean, Ukraine, Israel/Iran, Yemen, Venezuela, Nigeria)
   - **The asymmetry**: Either geopolitical risk is real → Mag7/semis too expensive. Or risk is overstated → Chinese tech too cheap. One side is wrong.
   - China as "de facto central bank" for emerging markets — building global influence
   - Metals complex "awash in opportunity" — supply constrained + demand tailwinds
   - Oil: Trump trying to suppress (Saudi deals, Venezuela), but other commodities less controllable

### Key Dollar-Relevant Takeaways from Investable Ideas

- **Explicit dollar call**: 5-10% decline in 2026 (DXY dimension)
- **Mechanism identified**: Trade deficit reduction → less capital inflows → monetization
- **NIIP at highs**: Peak foreign capital in US = turning point
- **Liberation Day as inflection**: The moment the "melting ice cube" of US capital inflows accelerated
- **Fed forced into monetization**: As foreign Treasury demand wanes, Fed must fill the gap
- **Non-US assets benefit**: Weaker dollar = tailwind for international equities, especially cheap Chinese stocks
- **Geopolitical premium on real assets**: US-China competition makes commodities/metals a "win-win" regardless of conflict outcome
